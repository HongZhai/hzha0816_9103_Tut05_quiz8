# Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

###### The artwork I chose is a light painting made by American artist *Stephen Knapp*.

###### He shaped glass of different colors and shapes to reflect light into the space. He believed it was a symphony of color and light. I wanted to incorporate light refraction and different colors into my work on *Piet Mondrian's "Broadway Boogie Woogie"*,

###### and be able to control the direction of the light based on different audio or based on the direction of the mouse. By importing different audio content, the work can present completely different content, so that the melody and picture can be integrated into one.

# Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
###### The coding technique I found comes from one of the works of one of the YouTube creators - *The Coding Train, 2D Raycasting*.

###### He uses Ray.js, Boundary.js and Sketch.js in P5.js to complete ray casting engine with line segment *boundarys* and vector *ray*. In future works I can use Boundry.js to set different points to connect into line segments to simulate the effect of glass to limit the direction of light. Use Ray.js to set the origin of the light and the width of the line segment. And define boundary and ray in Sketch.js, and then set the direction of the light based on the position of the mouse.

###### Here are some links about this technique
